CFFSW is the source for building http://cffsw.modernthings.org, Crowdfunded Free Software.


Introduction
------------

This is a static site generated by [Nikola](http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/). Posts (ie blog or catalogue entries) are contained in `cffsw/posts` and static pages (such as 'About', 'Contact') are contained in `cffsw/stories`.

It should not be necessary to install Nikola and other dependencies to modify an existing post or add a new one. To add a new one copy the structure of an existing file in posts.

To add a new post with Nikola: `nikola new_post` (will create a file with .txt which you can use Markdown syntax in)

To add a new post with [Textile](http://txstyle.org/) syntax: `nikla new_post -f textile`

To add a new page (story) with Nikola: `nikola new_post -p`


Nikola notes
------------

`pip install -r requirements.txt` should do it (should be just nikola + textile libs)

LICENSE only shows up in certain themes - monospace, orphan, default (not site)


To enable textile support:

post_pages should look like this:

<pre>
post_pages = (
    ("posts/*.txt", "posts", "post.tmpl", True),
    ("stories/*.txt", "", "story.tmpl", False),
    ("posts/*.textile", "posts", "post.tmpl", True),  # this is new
    ("stories/*.textile", "", "story.tmpl", False),  # this is new
)
</pre>

also `pip install textile`

Then `nikola new_post -f textile`
