A list of known crowdfunding campaigns where the result would be software released under a "free software":http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html license. Hopefully this can be a useful resource for free culture academics and would-be free software developers.

This is not a list of open source software for creating a Kickstarter clone. For that try "this list":http://seedingfactory.com/2013/04/list-of-open-source-crowdfunding-platforms/.

Some other sites that may be of interest:

* "Bountysource":https://www.bountysource.com/
* "Kickstarter 'open software' tag":http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/categories/open%20software (NB. seems to me this is a rather loose designation)
