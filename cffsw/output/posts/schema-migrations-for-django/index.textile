Django is the go-to Python web framework, with South a plugin for Schema migration. This campaign was to put the next generation of schema migrations directly in Django core, essentially a rewrite of South. It was funded within a matter of hours. The campaigner is a Django core committer, and the original author and principal maintainer of South.
